    ## PROBLEM DEFINITION


    A home improvement retailer, The Home Depot held a competition on Kaggle hoping to improve customer shopping experience.
    The task was to develop a model that accurately predicts the relevance score of search results, hence minimizing human input in the search relevance evaluation.
    
    In addition to predicting the relevance scores, I further used these scores to build a full-fledged search engine.

    --------------------------
    ## DATASET

    The data was provided in four csv files:

    1. train.csv : 
        - id - a unique Id representing (search_term, product_uid) pair
        - product_uid - an id for products
        - product_title - product titles
        - search_term - the search query
        - relevance - the average of the relevance ratings ranging from 1(not relevant) to 3(highly relevant) for a given id
    
    2. test.csv :
        - All the features of train data except for relevance score.

    3. product_description.csv:
        - product_uid - an id for products
        - product_description - verbose descriptions for products
    
    4. attributes.csv:
        - product_uid - an id for products
        - name - an attribute name
        - value - the attribute's value
    --------------------------

    """


def model_page():
    st.header('High Level Architecture')
    st.markdown(
    """
    ------------------------------
    """)

    st.image('https://i.imgur.com/2a7ONaI.png')
    
    st.markdown("<br>", unsafe_allow_html=True)

    """
    

    The main goal of this project is to present top ‘N’ relevant products as accurately as possible to the user with the product of highest relevance score being ranked first, second highest being ranked second and so on. This needs to be done within seconds, so it is not possible to calculate the relevance score for all the products in our database because predicting the relevance score for each product and then ranking all of them will take a significant amount of time which won’t satisfy the business constraint of low latency. On that account, I completed this task in two stages.

    In stage 1, I built a much simpler Information Retrieval model (The BM25 model). This model will retrieve the top ‘M’ (M = 100) products which are most relevant to the given search query. 

    In stage 2, the task was to predict relevance scores ranging from 1 to 3 which was mapped to machine learning as a regression problem since the scores are continuous real values. So, I built a supervised ML regression model which predicts the relevance scores more accurately for the subset (top ‘M’) of products retrieved by our first model and henceforth show the top ‘N’ (N=10) most relevant products to the user in decreasing order of relevance.
